Tasks App - Basic State Codelab
===============================

This codelab helped me learn all the basic APIs to work with state in a Jetpack Compose app, 
how to think about state and events to extract stateless composables in Compose
and how Compose uses state updates to drive change in the UI. Also learned how to use APIs like remember, rememberSaveable, State, MutableState and ViewModel.
